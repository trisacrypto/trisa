The Global TRISA Directory Service (GDS) facilitates peer-to-peer exchanges between TRISA members as follows:

- By providing discovery services for finding TRISA endpoints
- By issuing mTLS certificates to verify exchanges
- By providing certificate and KYC information for verification

Interactions with a Directory Service are specified by the TRISA protocol. Currently, the TRISA organization hosts the GDS on behalf of the TRISA network. This documentation describes the TRISA implementation of the directory service and TRISA-specific interactions with it.
