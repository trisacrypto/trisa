The goal of the Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture (TRISA) is to enable
compliance with the FATF and FinCEN Travel Rules for cryptocurrency transaction
identity information without modifying the core blockchain protocols, and without
incurring increased transaction costs or modifying virtual currency peer-to-peer
transaction flows.

## About the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

The Financial Action Task Force was founded to address concerns about money laundering
and the threat it poses to the world financial system. The inter-governmental body
advises 36 member countries and two regional organizations, and is one of the most
influential voices globally on combating financial crimes. The FATFâ€™s mandate was expanded
in 2001 to include efforts to combat terrorist financing (CFT). Its influence also extends
beyond its member countries, as a number of regional Financial Action Task Forces around
the world provide guidance to regulators in the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East,
and North Africa. Its MoneyVal associate provides guidance to countries of Europe outside
the EU, including Malta.
