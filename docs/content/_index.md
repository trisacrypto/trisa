# TRISA

The goal of the Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture (TRISA) is to enable
compliance with the FATF and FinCEN Travel Rules for cryptocurrency transaction
identity information without modifying the core blockchain protocols, and without
incurring increased transaction costs or modifying virtual currency peer-to-peer
transaction flows.

## About the TestNet

The TRISA TestNet has been established to provide a demonstration of the TRISA peer-to-peer protocol, host "robot VASP" services to facilitate TRISA integration, and is the location of the primary TRISA Directory Service that facilitates public key exchange and peer discovery.

The TRISA test net is comprised of the following services:

- [TRISA Directory Service](https://vaspdirectory.net) - a user interface to explore the TRISA Global Directory Service and register to become a TRISA member
- [TestNet Demo](https://vaspbot.net) - a demo site to show TRISA interactions between “robot” VASPs that run in the TestNet
