The purpose of the TRIXO questionnaire is to provide responses to a common set of questions VASPs might ask each other before exchanging Travel Rule information.

When [registering for TRISA membership]({{% ref "/joining-trisa/registration" %}}), applicants must submit their TRIXO questionnaire in JSON form (shown below) as part of their application. After a VASP has been issued certificates, these TRIXO details are logged in the [TRISA Global Directory Service]({{% ref "/gds" %}}) to facilitate member lookups and mutual verification ahead of information exchanges.

#### JSON Formatting

Below is a sample TRIXO form, containing all of the fields required during registration for the TRISA network.
