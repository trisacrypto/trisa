This portion of the documentation describes how to become a TRISA member so that you can receive Identity Certificates and use them to perform secure information transfers with other VASPs.

To join the TRISA network, you must [register]({{% ref "/joining-trisa/registration" %}}) with the TRISA [Global Directory Service (GDS)]({{% ref "/gds" %}}).

The mechanics of registration include two important workflows:

1. A KYV review process to ensure the network maintains trusted membership
2. Certificate issuance for mTLS authentication in the network

Next, learn more about the [process of registration]({{% ref "/joining-trisa/registration" %}}).
