To join the TRISA or TestNet networks, you must register with the TRISA Global Directory Service (GDS) or one of the jurisdiction-specific directory services. Registering with the directory service engages two workflows:

1. A KYV review process to ensure the network maintains trusted membership
2. Certificate issuance for mTLS authentication in the network

Coming soon: more details on the registration form, email verification, and the review process.
