To join the TRISA network, you must register with the [TRISA Global Directory Service (GDS)]({{< ref "/gds" >}}).

Registering with the directory service engages two workflows:

1. A KYV review process to ensure the network maintains trusted membership
2. Certificate issuance for mTLS authentication in the network
