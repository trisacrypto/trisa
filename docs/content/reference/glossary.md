- **Originator**: The initiator of a blockchain transaction and therefore also the initiator of a TRISA transfer. The "originator" can refer to the originating VASP, the originating customer of the VASP or both.

- **Beneficiary**: The recipient of a blockchain transaction and therefore also the recipient of a TRISA transfer. The "beneficiary" can refer to the beneficiary VASP, the beneficiary customer of the VASP or both.

- **Local vs Remote VASP**: A reference to the source of peer-to-peer traffic in an information exchange. The "local VASP" usually refers to the service you are running, while the "remote VASP" usually refers to some other VASP in the TRISA network. Local vs. Remote is often used to condition originator vs. beneficiary. If you are initiating the transaction then the local VASP is the originator and the remote VASP is the beneficiary. If you are receiving a transaction then the local VASP is the beneficiary and the remote VASP is the originator.
